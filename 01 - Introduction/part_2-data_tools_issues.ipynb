    "For this tutorial we are using two weather radar datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valentin will be teaching using the CPOL radar dataset, which is hosted on NCI under project hj10. CPOL radar was a polarimetric research weather radar in Darwin that operated from 1997-2017. The polarimetric information this radar provides much more robust retrievals of rainfall rate. Data from this project will be published for public access by June 2020 via NCI and level 1 data can be downloaded from the [ARM website](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/instruments/cpol).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this dataset, please contact Valentin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joshua will be teaching using the [Australian operation radar dataset](http://openradar.io/), which is hosted on NCI under project rq0. This dataset contains 700+ years of weather radar data from the Australian network of 70+ radars and level 1 data updated daily. The level 1 data from this project is already published, and level 2 data will be published by June 2020. To use the level 1 data, please reference the following [doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.25914/5cb686a8d9450). A majority of radar data in this archive in non-polarimetric and can be prone to more issues than CPOL. To use the level 2 dataset, please contact Joshua.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets consist of different product levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 1: Uncorrected radar data in the native spherical coordinates. Typically used if you want to generate custom products/analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 2: Derived products in 2D cartesian coodinates using corrected radar data. These products are typically at a set altitude and include rainfall rate, classification etc. Data is organised into daily netcdf files for rapid analysis using xarrays etc. Corrections applied included those for attenuation, clutter removal and reflectivity calibration. \n",

    "- [PyART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/): is a Python module containing a collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities. Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility for working with data from a number of its precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many types of weather radars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [wradlib](https://docs.wradlib.org/en/stable/): The ωradlib project has been initiated in order facilitate the use of weather radar data as well as to provide a common platform for research on new algorithms. ωradlib is designed to assist you in the most important steps of processing weather radar data. These may include: reading common data formats, georeferencing, converting reflectivity to rainfall intensity, identifying and correcting typical error sources (such as clutter or attenuation) and visualising the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Processing Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- [netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html): python interface to the netCDF version 4 library (.nc files).\n",
    "- [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/): a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format (format used for Australian operational radars).\n",
    "- [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/): Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun! allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone experience! Builds upon the interfaces that pandas uses.\n",
